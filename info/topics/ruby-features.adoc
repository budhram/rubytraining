=== Overview

==== Nearly Pure Object Oriented

Almost everything is Object making it purely Object Oriented programming language. 
Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. 
Every object has their properties and actions.

==== Dynamic typing and Duck typing

Ruby is a dynamic programming language and its programs are not compiled. The type of any datatype
is determined at runtime.

Ruby variables are loosely typed language which means any variable can hold any type of object. 
When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. 
This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.

[info]
====
"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"â€”to determine if an object can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.

==== Flexibility

Ruby is a flexible language. It allows you to easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish. Eg: One can open a Integer class and redefine the implementation of `+` into multiplication operation.

==== Metaprogramming

Ruby allows you to operate on the programs as the data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running. In some cases, this allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution, in turn reducing development time. It also allows programs greater flexibility to efficiently handle new situations without recompilation.

==== Mixins

Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.

==== Natural English-like Appearance

The Ruby program prefers English keyword and some punctuation for decoration. It doesn't need variable declaration.
Eg:
```ruby
if 5 > 2 then print "Good" else print "bad" end
```

==== Variable constants

In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.

==== Naming Conventions

Ruby defines some naming conventions for its variable, method, constant and class.

- *Constant*: Starts with a capital letter
- *Global variable*: Starts with a dollar sign (`$`)
- *Instance variable*: Starts with a (`@`) sign
- *Class variable*: Starts with a (`@@`) sign
- *Method name*: Allowed to start with a capital letter

==== Default Arguments

A default argument is an argument to a function that a programmer is not required to specify. In most programming languages, functions may take one or more arguments. Usually, each argument must be specified in full (like in `C`).

==== Special Method Names

Methods are allowed to end with question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!). By convention, methods that answer questions end with question mark and methods that indicates that method can change the state of the object end with exclamation mark.

==== Statement delimiters

Multiple statements in a single line must contain semi colon in between but not at the end of a line.

==== Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB)

It is a REPL(Read, Eval, Print, Loop) for Ruby language. The abbreviation `irb` comes from the fact that the filename extension for Ruby is ".rb", although interactive Ruby files do not have an extension of ".irb".

The program is launched from a command line and allows the execution of Ruby commands with immediate response, experimenting in real-time. It features command history, line editing capabilities, and job control, and is able to communicate directly as a shell script over the Internet and interact with a live server. It was developed by Keiju Ishitsuka.

==== Rubygems

All the packages of Ruby are managed via Rubygems. A gem is nothing but a package.

==== Major OS Support

Ruby is available in most of the available OS today including Windows, macOS and Linux.

==== Garbage Collection

Ruby support garbage collection of unused objects automatically. Programmers need not to release objects manually.
The strategies of Garbage collection has evolved from `Mark & Sweep` to `Incremental Sweep` in Ruby 2.2.
