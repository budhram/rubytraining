=== Overview

Hash is similar to Array but it is a indexed collection of object references.
However, while integer is used as an index in Array, Hash's index can be objects of any types like String, Regular Expression and so on.
When you store a value in a Hash, you are actually supplying two objects - the index (normally called the _key_) and the _value_.
You can subsequently retrieve the value by using the Hash key(index).

NOTE: The values in a Hash can be objects of any type. Hash default value is `nil` when an attempt is made to access key that doesn't exist.

=== Try yourself

- Symbol as key
```ruby
h1 = { :font_size=> 10, :font_family => "Arial" }
puts 'length => ', h1.length
puts h1[:font_size]
puts h1
```

- String as key
```ruby
h2 = {'dog'=> 'canine', 'cat' => 'feline', 'donkey' => 'asinine', 12 => 'dodecine'}
puts 'length => ', h2.length
puts h2['dog']
puts h2
puts h2[12]
```

- Value update
```ruby
h1 = { abc: "foo" } # {:abc=>"foo"}
h1[:abc]						# "foo"
h1[:abc] = "bar"		# "bar"
h1[:abc]						# "bar"
```

WARNING: The **key** in the format `{symbol: value}` can't be numeric. Eg. `{1: 'one'}` will not work but `{1 => 'one'}` will work.
