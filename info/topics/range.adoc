=== Overview

Range is used to express a sequence.
Sequences have a start point, an end point, and a way to produce successive values in the sequence.
In Ruby, these sequences are created using the `..` and `...` range operators.
The two dot form creates an inclusive range, and the three-dot form creates a range that excludes the specified high value.
In Ruby, Ranges are not represented internally as lists i.e the sequence `1..100000` is held as a Range object containing references to two Fixnum objects.
If you need to, you can convert a range to a list using the `to_a` method.

```ruby
(1..10).to_a -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

=== Try yourself

Ranges implement methods that let you iterate over them and test their contents in a variety of ways.

```ruby
digits = -1..9
puts digits.include?(5)          # true
puts digits.min                  # -1
puts digits.max                  # 9
puts digits.reject {|i| i < 5 }  # [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Range is also widely used as an interval test i.e seeing if some value falls within the interval represented by the Range.
We do this using `===` (the case equality operator).

```ruby
(1..10) === 5       -> true
(1..10) === 15      -> false
(1..10) === 3.14159 -> true
('a'..'j') === 'c'  -> true
('a'..'j') === 'z'  -> false
```
