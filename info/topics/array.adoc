[[ruby-array-overview]]
=== Overview

An Array is just a list of items in order (like mangoes, apples, and oranges).
Every slot in the list acts like a variable: you can see what object a particular slot points to, and you can make it point to a different object.

[[ruby-array-notes]]
=== Notes

- You can make an array by using square brackets, `[ ]`
- First value in an array has index `0`
- The `size` and `length` methods return the number of elements of the array
- Negative index values count from the end of the array, so the last element has an index of `-1`
- `nil` is returned if a non-existent index is being accessed, ( index >= size )
- Mutable and are dynamically re-sizable, append elements to them and they grow as needed

[[ruby-array-code-snippets]]
=== Try yourself

- Array with similar object
```ruby
var1 = ['Hello', 'Goodbye']
puts var1[0]
puts var1[1]
```

- Array with different object
```ruby
flavour = 'mango'
var2 = [80.5, flavour, [true, false]]
puts var2[2]
```

- Array element addition
```ruby
name = ['Satish', 'Talim', 'Ruby', 'Java',]     # notice a trailing comma
puts name[0]
puts name[1]
puts name[2]
puts name[3]
# the next one outputs nil
# nil is Ruby's way of saying nothing
puts name[4]            # <1>
name[4] = 'Pune'
puts name[4]
name[5] = 4.33          # <2>
puts name[5]
name[6] = [1, 2, 3]     # <2>
puts name[6]
```
<1> Output is nil as it's a way of saying nothing in Ruby
<2> We can other type of data too

<<<

- Few methods on Array
```ruby
newarr = [45, 23, 1, 90]
puts 'sort on array ==>>', newarr.sort
puts 'length on array ==>>', newarr.length
puts 'first element of array ==>>', newarr.first
puts 'last element of array ==>>', newarr.last
```

- Iteration on Array
```ruby
locations = ['Pune', 'Mumbai', 'Bangalore']

locations.each do |loc|
  puts 'I love ' + loc + '!'
  puts "Don't you?"
end
```

- A small task
```ruby
# Delete an entry in the middle and "shift" the remaining entries
locations.delete('Mumbai') # <1>
locations.each do |loc|
  puts 'I love ' + loc + '!'
  puts "Don't you?"
end
```
<1> Not to be confused with the `shift` method.
