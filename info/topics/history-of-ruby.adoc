==== Concept

[quote, Matz, http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/382]
Well, Ruby was born in Feb. 23 1993.  At that day, I was talking with
my colleague about the possibility of object-oriented scripting
language.  I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it
really, because it had smell of toy language (it still has).  The
object-oriented scripting language seemed very promising.
I knew Python then.  But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it
was a true object-oriented language.  OO features are appeared to be
add-on to the language. ...

He looked around and not found a language suited for him and decided to create his own. 
After spending several months writing an interpreter, he finally published the first public version of Ruby (0.95) to various Japanese domestic newsgroups in December, 1995.

==== Name

"Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.
